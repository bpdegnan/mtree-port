This is a port of the mtree port from archiecobbs/mtree-port:master; however, it has modifications to compile on recent Linux kernels (6.1.0-22) as well as MacOS (22.6.0).
The changes are specific to create.c and compare.c and look for #ifdef __linux__, such as:

#ifdef __linux__
    if ((s->st_mtimespec.tv_sec != p->fts_statp->st_mtim.tv_sec) ||
        (s->st_mtimespec.tv_nsec != p->fts_statp->st_mtim.tv_nsec)) {
#else
    if ((s->st_mtimespec.tv_sec != p->fts_statp->st_mtimespec.tv_sec) ||
        (s->st_mtimespec.tv_nsec != p->fts_statp->st_mtimespec.tv_nsec)) {
#endif
